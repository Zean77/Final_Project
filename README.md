# Final_Project

## Description: 
Our group uses machine learning to predict the number of bikes that are rented each day based on a number of inputs. Bike-Sharing has become increasingly popular in major cities. Here in the twin cities, we have the bike-sharing nonprofit Nice Ride MN. We want to analyze these data to draw some insights and help the Nice Ride to make better business decisions

* A linear regression model that predict the daily bike transaction based on daily weather inputs. 
* A logistic regression model to classify whether daily bike use is above or below the average for the year. 
* Analyzed the station demand to determine if adequate docks are provided at each station, does it has a seasonal demand change, and etc. 


## Data Source
Climate data comes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  OpenWeatherMap, Kaggle, and also open data shared by the company Nice Ride MN.
